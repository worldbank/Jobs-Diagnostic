# What is the JObs INdicator Tool? 

THE JOIN indicator tool is an excel-based tool that uses the JOIN input data while giving users the option to customize their own analysis. The tool is based on disaggregated data from JOIN. Users can choose the country they want to inspect, the timeline, and the survey types. Several predefined pivot tables are used to nest the data by several subgroups including gender, urban/rural, age groups, employment status, employment types, sectors, occupations, and education level. To enable further analyses, users cancustomize these pivot tables, for example, by changing the subgroups of the data set they want to look at from urban versus rural to education level by gender. Although the level of analysis
is more granular than in JOIN, the sampling strategy in the original survey may limit the representativity of the results. Therefore, users need to be careful with the interpretation as many surveys are only representative at a large level of analysis. It should be noted that there is no violation in the data-sharing
agreements, and privacy is kept at a high standard. 

# How can I access the tool? 

The tool can be downloaded [here](https://development-data-hub-s3-public.s3.amazonaws.com/ddhfiles/160361/join_benchmarking_tool.zip). 
Alternatively, it can be accessed from this Github by downloading and combining the zipped JOIN_Benchmarking files as well as the JOIN_Benchmarking_Tool file.

# Can I add my own surveys to this tool? 
Yes, this is possible. As long as they follow the I2D2/GMD/GLD normenclatura you can run the do-file in this GitHub to add your own surveys. You will need four other datasets that are stored in the Data folder to successfully run the code. Please save them in one Data folder and then follow the instructions in the do-file.
