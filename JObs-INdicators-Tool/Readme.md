What is the JObs INdicator Tool? 

THE JOIN indicator tool is an excel-based tool that uses the JOIN input data while giving users the option to customize their own analysis. The tool is based on disaggregated data from JOIN. Users can choose the country they want to inspect, the timeline, and the survey types. Several predefined pivot tables are used to nest the data by several subgroups including gender, urban/rural, age groups, employment status, employment types, sectors, occupations, and education level. To enable further analyses, users cancustomize these pivot tables, for example, by changing the subgroups of the data set they want to look at from urban versus rural to education level by gender. Although the level of analysis
is more granular than in JOIN, the sampling strategy in the original survey may limit the representativity of the results. Therefore, users need to be careful with the interpretation as many surveys are only representative at a large level of analysis. It should be noted that there is no violation in the data-sharing
agreements, and privacy is kept at a high standard.
